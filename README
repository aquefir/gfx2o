This tool converts graphical sources into GBA-compatible binaries in object
file format, ready for linking. It uses metadata in the file’s extensions to
discern the desired output properties, and resolves any directory hierarchy
as well as the data type into the symbol name for namespacing. Run
‘gfx2o --help’ for details.
